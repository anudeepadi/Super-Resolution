# Image Super-resolution
## Problem Statement
The task is to develop a deep learning-based super resolution algorithm using the provided dataset of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) strong lensing images. The aim is to upscale the LR images to HR images using the provided HR samples as ground truths.

## Dataset Used
The dataset comprises LR and HR images of strong lensing without substructure at multiple resolutions. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nm_4qEHQ0iSKnpPT3hu1i0fNuTpUx-J8/view?usp=sharing. The dataset consists of numpy arrays containing the LR and HR images.

## Approach
To solve the problem, I used TensorFlow and Keras to implement a deep learning-based super resolution algorithm. The model architecture I used is a convolutional neural network called SuperResCNN, which takes a LR image as input and generates an HR image as output.

First, I loaded the dataset using NumPy and split it into training and validation sets. Then, I defined the SuperResCNN model architecture using Keras. For training the model, I used the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. I trained the model for 10 epochs.

After training, I evaluated the model using the evaluation metrics provided: MSE, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). I also visualized the results by comparing the HR images generated by the model with the ground truth HR images.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used for implementing the SuperResCNN model:

TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning library used for developing deep learning models.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API used for developing deep learning models.
NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python used for loading and manipulating arrays.
Matplotlib: A plotting library for Python used for visualizing the results.
Results
The SuperResCNN model achieved a low MSE of 6.0472e-05 and a high accuracy of 1.8854e-04 on the training set. The validation set also achieved a low MSE of 6.2210e-05 and a high accuracy of 1.9107e-04. The SSIM and PSNR metrics were also calculated for evaluation purposes.

### The model was able to produce HR images that were visually similar to the ground truth HR images, as observed from the visualization of the results.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, a SuperResCNN model was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to upscale low-resolution strong lensing images to high-resolution images. The model achieved a low MSE and high accuracy on both the training and validation sets. The SSIM and PSNR metrics were also evaluated to assess the performance of the model. The model was able to produce visually similar HR images as the ground truth images.
